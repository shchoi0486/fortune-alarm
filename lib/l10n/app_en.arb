  "tarotSuccessMeaning11": "You receive a fair evaluation and legitimate compensation.",
  "tarotSuccessDetail11": "You will receive a fair and objective evaluation of your work performance. If you've worked hard, legitimate rewards like promotions or bonuses will follow, and you can demonstrate your abilities in fields requiring accuracy like law or accounting. When making decisions, exclude emotions and judge based strictly on data and facts.",
  "tarotKeywords12": "Sacrifice, patience, new perspective, stagnation, enlightenment",
  "tarotDesc12": "A man hanging upside down from a tree looks at the world from a new perspective through voluntary hardship and gains enlightenment.",
  "tarotLoveMeaning12": "The relationship may stagnate or unrequited feelings may last for a long time.",
  "tarotLoveDetail12": "You may feel frustrated because the progress of love is stalled, but rushing won't solve anything now. Stop for a moment and look at the current situation from a different perspective, reflecting on whether you've been forcing love only in your own way. The patience to think and care from the other person's position will eventually be the key to opening their heart.",
  "tarotWealthMeaning12": "Fund flow may be tied up or you may have to bear losses.",
  "tarotWealthDetail12": "You may feel completely blocked financially. Invested money may be tied up or expected income may be delayed, but the more you struggle, the more tangled it might get. It's better to empty your mind and observe for now. Use this period to check your consumption habits and re-establish your values regarding money.",
  "tarotSuccessMeaning12": "Work may not proceed as planned and may be delayed.",
  "tarotSuccessDetail12": "Projects might be suspended or work delayed, causing stress, but this is a temporary stop signal rather than a failure. Don't try to force progress; instead, step back and redraw the overall picture. Brilliant ideas can emerge when you break fixed ideas, and current trials will give you new enlightenment.",
  "tarotKeywords13": "Ending, change, rebirth, separation, new beginning",
  "tarotDesc13": "It symbolizes the complete termination of the old and a new beginning resulting from it, representing a painful but inevitable process of change.",
  "tarotLoveMeaning13": "It means the end of a relationship or a big change.",
  "tarotLoveDetail13": "The current relationship may have reached its limit. You need the courage to let it flow naturally rather than trying to hold on; separation is painful, but a better new beginning always waits at the end. Remember that a place for a new person is created only when you completely escape from past lingering feelings or wounds.",
  "tarotWealthMeaning13": "Difficult situations such as financial losses or investment failures may come.",
  "tarotWealthDetail13": "A big change is expected financially. You might experience losses in trusted investments or face difficulties with unexpected expenses, but this is a signal to change inefficient asset management methods. Organize your debts and completely cut off unnecessary spending to use this as a stepping stone for a healthier financial structure.",
  "tarotSuccessMeaning13": "Work in progress may be interrupted or failed.",
  "tarotSuccessDetail13": "A project you worked hard on might fall through, or you could experience major changes at work. While the sense of frustration will be great for now, this is a revelation of destiny to organize work that doesn't fit you and find a new path for greater success. If you discard old ways and start with a completely new mindset, a more wonderful next chapter will open.",
  "tarotKeywords14": "Balance, temperance, harmony, healing, moderation",
  "tarotDesc14": "Water is transferred between two cups, symbolizing perfect balance between reality and ideals and a harmonious flow.",
  "tarotLoveMeaning14": "It's a process of two different people meeting and achieving harmony.",
  "tarotLoveDetail14": "A subtle and lasting love suits this period better than burning passion. You'll build deep bonds by acknowledging and complementing each other's differences, and if there are conflicts, you need the wisdom to solve them through calm conversation. Your gentle and caring attitude will put your partner's mind at ease and create a stable relationship.",
  "tarotWealthMeaning14": "It's important to balance income and spending.",
  "tarotWealthDetail14": "Your financial stability follows a stable flow. Focus on efficiently allocating and managing current assets rather than aiming for a windfall, and a habit of appropriately adjusting spending as income increases is needed. If you invest, it's good to diversify for risk management, and steady management will eventually bring wealth.",
  "tarotSuccessMeaning14": "The ability to coordinate different opinions and lead harmony stands out.",
  "tarotSuccessDetail14": "You'll excellently perform as a mediator in team projects, resolving conflicts and increasing work efficiency. Your flexible thinking and adaptability will be recognized, and the wisdom to prevent burnout by balancing work and rest will stand out.

  "tarotKeywords15": "Temptation, bondage, obsession, materialism, addiction",
  "tarotDesc15": "It symbolizes desires and obsessions that bind oneself, and material temptations that one could escape if they chose, but fails to do so.",
  "tarotLoveMeaning15": "It means a relationship attracted to or obsessed with intense physical charm.",
  "tarotLoveDetail15": "It's a time when it's hard to make rational judgments because you're strongly fascinated by someone's charm. A hot romance that might keep you awake at night could start, but on the other hand, you need caution as you might suffer from excessive obsession and restraint. Coolly reflect on whether your feelings are true love or just simple desire or possessiveness.",
  "tarotWealthMeaning15": "Material greed becomes excessive, so you may invest excessively.",
  "tarotWealthDetail15": "A time with many financial temptations. There's a risk of putting money into dangerous places deceived by sweet words, or squandering assets through impulsive luxury purchases. Be wary of becoming a slave to money and losing trust, and focus on protecting what you have rather than new investments.",
  "tarotSuccessMeaning15": "You may try to use any means for success.",
  "tarotSuccessDetail15": "Greed for power or honor increases. There is a concern about falling into work addiction, such as setting unreasonable schedules for performance or neglecting health.

  "tarotDesc16": "Lightning strikes the tower, collapsing it and people are falling.",
  "tarotLoveMeaning16": "A big crisis or a sudden breakup may come to the relationship.",
  "tarotLoveDetail16": "An unexpected event like a bolt from the blue can occur on the love front. You might be disappointed in someone you trusted or face a conflict that shakes the relationship to its roots, but don't despair. This is a process of breaking unhealthy relationships or misunderstandings to face the truth, and an opportunity to build a firmer love will eventually come.",
  "tarotWealthMeaning16": "You should prepare for sudden financial losses or disasters.",
  "tarotWealthDetail16": "It's a very unstable time financially. You may hear shocking news such as big money leaving or an investment collapsing, so move your assets to a safe place and prepare. However, this collapse will be an opportunity to correct wrong economic concepts, and after hitting rock bottom, a chance to build a solid foundation will come.",
  "tarotSuccessMeaning16": "Projects may be interrupted or shocking changes at work may occur.",
  "tarotSuccessDetail16": "You may feel frustration as if the tower you've worked hard to build is collapsing, but this is due to an inevitable flow of change rather than a lack of ability. Don't panic; grasp the situation coolly, discard old systems, and seek new paths. If you take this crisis as an opportunity to reorganize, you can leap to a much higher place.",
  "tarotKeywords17": "Hope, inspiration, healing, optimism, wish fulfillment",

  "tarotWealthMeaning17": "The financial situation gradually improves.",
  "tarotWealthDetail17": "Your financial outlook starts to flow in a positive direction. Previous economic difficulties are resolved and a ray of light is seen, and an opportunity to increase side income through creative ideas may arise. Rather than immediate big gains, an eye for investing in places with high future value from a long-term perspective will lead you to financial stability.",
  "tarotSuccessMeaning17": "Creative inspiration springs up and you get an opportunity to spread your talent widely.",
  "tarotSuccessDetail17": "Your ideas shine and receive praise from those around you. You can stand out in marketing, PR, or artistic fields, and it's a very good time to start a project you've always dreamed of. If you express yourself confidently, luck is in for you to gain popularity or honor, so seize the opportunity.",
  "tarotKeywords18": "Anxiety, illusion, ambiguity, intuition, unconscious",
  "tarotDesc18": "At night when the moon is up, a dog and a wolf howl and a crayfish crawls out of the water, symbolizing unseen truths and the subconscious.",
  "tarotLoveMeaning18": "It's frustrating because you don't know the other person's heart, and suspicion are easy to sprout.",
  "tarotLoveDetail18": "It's a time when you're anxious because you don't know the other person's inner thoughts, as if in a fog. Trivial misunderstandings can grow into suspicion and cause sleepless nights, so it's better to watch the situation calmly rather than hastily interrogating. Instead of clinging to uncertain relationships swept by emotions, prioritize finding your center through rational thinking.",
  "tarotWealthMeaning18": "Investment prospects are opaque and there is a risk of fraud.",
  "tarotWealthDetail18": "Your vision is blurred in terms of finance, so there is a high risk of being deceived by plausible investment information or sweet words. Since traps are hidden in unseen places, it's a time to be extremely careful, as if tapping a stone bridge before crossing. Rather than starting new things, protecting your assets through thorough realistic verification is the way.",
  "tarotSuccessMeaning18": "It's a confusing time because the direction of work may be ambiguous.",
  "tarotSuccessDetail18": "You may find yourself in a hopeless situation where you can't see ahead, and you should be careful with your words and actions as project direction may be shaken or you may be caught in workplace rumors. It's wise to wait until the situation becomes clear rather than moving hastily, and it's good to guard your position silently and focus on mental management.",

  "tarotLoveDetail20": "Waiting news arrives. If you've been waiting for contact from an ex-lover you couldn't forget or wishing for a reunion, it's very likely to come true, and stagnant 'some' relationships will bear fruit by clearly developing into lovers. A new connection with someone you knew in the past might also occur, so listen to your heart and make a decision without regret.",
  "tarotWealthMeaning20": "You may get profits from previous investments, or get back money you lent.",
  "tarotWealthDetail20": "It's a time to receive rewards for past efforts. There's an unexpected windfall, such as forgotten stocks rising or receiving back money you didn't expect to get, and an opportunity to succeed by retrying ideas that failed before. Since the decision you make now will greatly influence your future wealth, careful yet bold determination is needed.",
  "tarotSuccessMeaning20": "Your efforts will be recognized and you will be promoted or rewarded.",
